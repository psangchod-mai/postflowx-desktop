# PostFlowX — Security / Correctness Audit Report

Rotating audit per the nightly working agreement (Epic E_rolling). One area per pass.

---

## 2026-06-27 — Area: Electron IPC / preload boundary + main-process subprocess & path handling

Scope: `electron/ipc.js`, `electron/preload.js`, `electron/main.js`, companion subprocess/XML. Goal: path traversal, command injection, unvalidated renderer→main paths, XML XXE, and the DOM-XSS sinks those primitives elevate.

### Summary
| Severity | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| — (safe) | No shell injection anywhere (`shell:true`/`os.system`/`shell=True` absent; `.exec(` hits are all regex) | ✔ verified clean |
| — (safe) | `pfx:deleteProject` path-confined (`resolve`+relative-check+manifest gate+`trashItem`, not `rm`) | ✔ well-hardened |
| — (safe) | `pfx:openExternal` allows only `http(s)://` | ✔ ok |
| Low (by design) | `pfx:readFile` / `pfx:writeFile` / `pfx:saveFile` are **unconfined arbitrary-path** R/W | accepted — desktop capability; documented as impact-multiplier |
| Resolved | Companion XML parsing was XXE-vulnerable (`ET.fromstring`/`ET.parse`) | ✅ fixed earlier today via `safe_xml` (all 6 files) |
| **Medium** | **Inconsistent HTML-escaping** — untrusted strings (error messages, file paths) interpolated into `innerHTML` unescaped in some sinks | ⚠ partially fixed (see below) |

### Medium finding — DOM XSS via unescaped `innerHTML` interpolation
**Chain:** macOS filenames may contain `<>"'&`. A maliciously-named OCF file (or a companion/decoder error echoing such a path) reaches an `innerHTML` sink that interpolates the string without escaping → arbitrary script in the renderer. Because the IPC surface exposes **unconfined `pfx:readFile`/`pfx:writeFile`**, renderer script execution escalates to arbitrary local file read/write (exfiltration / tampering). Hence Medium, not Low.

**Good news:** an escaping discipline already exists and is used widely — `_esc()` / `escapeHtml()` in `aceslook`, `mediaSearch`, `imf_ui`, `visualQcModal`, `vfxPullPanel` (thumbs), etc. The gap is *inconsistency*: a subset of error/label sinks skip it.

**Confirmed unescaped sinks (file/error-derived input):**
- `prep_mark.js` — OCF strip error cell: `title="${r.error}"...${stageLabel}` ✅ FIXED (`_escHtml`)
- `prep_mark.js` — OCF drop-zone relink error: `Error: ${err.message}` ✅ FIXED
- `prep_mark.js` — OCF error pane: ` Stage: ${r.stage}.` ✅ FIXED (defense-in-depth)
- `ui.js:3690` — ACES Look load error `${err.message}` ✅ FIXED (`escapeHtml`; low — JS load error, defense-in-depth)
- `cutdiff/index.js:4165` — triaged ✔ SAFE: `ensureRow` only ever called with **hardcoded literals** (`'cutdiffDiffTlTrackOldAudio','OLD A'`). No untrusted input.
- `vfxPullPanel.js:355` — triaged ✔ SAFE: `_wsRenderFallbackOrError` `label` is always `'OCF'`/`'QT REF'` and `msg` resolves to fixed strings (raw `e.message` is only used in `.includes()`, never interpolated).

**Fix applied this pass:** added `_escHtml()` to `prep_mark.js` and wrapped the three file/error-derived OCF sinks above. Escaping contract locked by `tests-js/escHtml.test.mjs` (8 assertions incl. `<img onerror>`, attribute-breakout, malicious path). `build-verify` green.

**Renderer-wide sweep (2nd pass, same day):** grepped all `src/scripts/` `innerHTML` sinks for untrusted-var interpolation NOT already wrapped in an escape helper. The codebase is largely disciplined (`esc`/`esc2`/`_esc`/`_xesc`/`_pmEscHtml`/`escapeHtml` in wide use). Additional unescaped file/error-derived sinks found + fixed:
- `imf_ui.js:1723/1731` — `_labelQc.error` (+ `metaBits` lines) from IAB ADM parsing ✅ FIXED (`_esc`)
- `core/markerProxySettings.js:34` — media-root `title="${r.path}"` + `${r.label||r.path}` (raw file paths) ✅ FIXED (added local `_esc`)
Confirmed SAFE (literals/app-constants, no fix): `cutdiff/index.js:4165`, `vfxPullPanel.js:355`, `prep_mark.js:15224` (color palette names).

**Recommended follow-ups (Epic E):**
1. ✅ done — every flagged + swept untrusted sink escaped (prep_mark ×3, ui.js ×1, imf_ui ×2, markerProxySettings ×1); remainder confirmed literal-only.
2. Minor tidy: `prep_mark.js` now has two escape helpers (`_escHtml` top-of-file + pre-existing `_pmEscHtml` @16340) — consolidate to one.
3. ✅ done — built `tools/scan-innerhtml.mjs` (`npm run scan:xss`): heuristic scanner listing `innerHTML` interpolations not wrapped in a known escaper. It **found a sink manual grep missed** — `aceslook/cards/SourceDetectionCard.js:15` interpolated the dropped **file name** (`state.source.name`) unescaped → ✅ FIXED (8th sink). Remaining ~313 candidates spot-checked as safe-by-construction (composed `_esc`-wrapped table fragments, numeric/version labels, app-constant ternaries). Tool is a review aid, not a hard gate (would false-positive on safe composed fragments).
3. Defense-in-depth: scope `pfx:readFile`/`pfx:writeFile` to known roots (project folder / media root / cache) where feasible, or require an allowlisted prefix.
4. Confirm a restrictive CSP on the renderer (`script-src 'self'`) — would blunt the whole XSS class even where escaping is missed.

---

## 2026-06-27 (2nd area) — Archive extraction & path traversal (write paths)

| Severity | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| — (safe) | No archive extraction-to-disk anywhere — JS `lib/zip.js` reads entries **into memory** (`unzipOne`/`unzip`); companion has no `zipfile`/`tarfile`/`extractall`. Zip-slip not a vector. | ✔ verified clean |
| **Medium** | **Path traversal on WRITE** in companion EXR/AMF delivery + render: `shotName` (editorial/EDL-derived) and `outputPattern` (renderer-supplied) flowed into `os.path.join(output_dir, …)` unsanitized → a crafted `../` name writes outside the chosen output dir. | ✅ FIXED |

**Fix:** added `_safe_name_component` (neutralizes `/` `\` `..`), `_confined_join` (realpath+commonpath confinement under the output dir — catches `../`, absolute, symlink escapes), and `_safe_output_pattern` (rejects separator/traversal patterns → safe default). Applied in `_ocf_copy_exr_delivery` (shotName sanitized + confined; AMF filename uses the safe segment) and at both write-path `outputPattern` reads (`api.py:2354`, `:3796`). A blocked shot returns a clean per-shot error, not a crash. Tests: `companion/tests/test_path_confinement.py` (6 assertions: legit-pass, `..`/abs/separator rejection). Companion suite 126→**132 passed**. Shipped (companion = extraResources, verified in bundle).

---

## 2026-06-27 (3rd area) — Companion IPC input validation (read / delete / copy paths)

Reviewed every companion handler that reads, deletes, or copies a path, asking: is any **renderer-supplied** path used to return file contents (arbitrary read / exfiltration) or to delete/overwrite arbitrary locations?

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| File read → data-URL return (`_file_to_data_url`, still/thumb extracts) | ✔ all read **internally-generated** cache/temp/render-output paths (`cache_dir/{cache_key}.fmt`, `tmp.name`, `found_path`) — never a raw renderer path |
| `unlink`/`rmtree` operations (api.py, proxy_service.py) | ✔ operate on **internal job-state** paths (companion-created outputs) or suffix-filtered cache entries — not raw renderer input |
| Copy SOURCES (`exrFolder`, `amfPath` in delivery) | accepted — user-initiated first-party reads into the now-confined delivery dir; not an escalation |

**Conclusion: clean.** No arbitrary read-and-return or arbitrary-delete primitive is exposed; the renderer-controlled **write** path (fixed in area 2) was the real exposure. Negative result recorded for audit trail.

---

## 2026-06-27 (4th area) — Companion localhost HTTP media server (`http_server.py`)

A localhost HTTP server (default :47125) serves media frames/proxies to the renderer — a real attack surface. Reviewed bind, auth, path handling, CORS.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Bind address | ✔ **127.0.0.1** in both modes (api.py `ensure_http_server` default + app.py `--host` default) — no LAN exposure |
| Auth | ✔ random per-run token (`secrets.token_hex(24)`), **constant-time** `compare_digest`, via `X-PFX-Token` header or `?token=` |
| Token-exempt routes | ✔ `/ping`+`/health` return status only; `/file/{assetId}` is a **capability URL** — unguessable per-session UUID, only companion-registered files, localhost-bound |
| Path traversal | ✔ every served name rejects `"/" "\\" ".."`; `_safe_proxy_stem` sanitizes proxy names |
| CORS `*` | acceptable — content is still token/capability-gated; `*` only enables the renderer's cross-origin `fetch` |

**Conclusion: clean / well-hardened.** Note (informational, not a vuln): `/file/{assetId}` security rests on UUID unguessability + localhost — fine as a capability design; just don't log/leak those URLs externally.

**Audit scorecard (4 areas):** IPC/preload+XSS → 2 fixed (XXE + 8 sinks); path-traversal → 1 fixed; IPC read/delete → clean; HTTP server → clean. Plus `npm run scan:xss` regression tool.

### Method notes
- `ipcMain.handle` surface enumerated (44 handlers); destructive/path ones reviewed by hand.
- Subprocess grep across `electron/` + `companion/src` for shell-exec patterns → none.
- `innerHTML` interpolation grep across `src/scripts/` → 575 sinks; high-risk (filename/error/clip/tc) subset reviewed.

## 2026-07-26 (5th area) — Test/verification integrity: does `build-verify` actually verify?

Rotating area chosen deliberately: every prior entry in this report and in the nightly backlog rests on the sentence "`build-verify` green". That claim had never itself been audited. It should have been — it was false.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `build-verify` runs the JS suites | ✔ `test:node` + `test:js` genuinely execute and fail loudly |
| `build-verify` runs the Python suite | ✘ **HIGH — fails open.** `(cd companion && python3 -m pytest -q)` → `No module named pytest`. No pytest in the macOS CLT python3, none in Homebrew python3.14, no `.venv` in the tree, no `pytest` binary on PATH. The 250-test companion suite **never ran**, and the gate still reported a pass |
| Security gates (`scan-innerhtml`, `scan-rawxml`) | ✔ both execute and gate correctly |
| Coverage of the IAB/S-ADM parser | ✘ **MEDIUM.** Its only test file is `skipif`-gated on a hundreds-of-MB Meridian MXF present on one workstation. Effectively 0 coverage of a parser that consumes untrusted package XML |

**Impact.** This is a meta-vulnerability, not a code one, and it is the more dangerous kind: it silently invalidated the verification evidence behind every hardening claim in this report. The XXE work in particular ("companion pytest 126/126 pass") was being re-asserted by a gate that had stopped running those tests. The fixes were real — re-running the suite properly now yields 250 passed / 7 skipped — but the *evidence* was not.

**Fixed.** `tools/run-pytest.mjs` resolves an interpreter (`companion/.venv` → `$PFX_PYTHON` → PATH), verifies `import pytest` succeeds *before* running, and exits 1 with the venv-creation command otherwise. A missing interpreter is now a red gate, not a green one. Wired into `test:py` / `build-verify` / `test`.

**Also fixed (correctness, found while closing the coverage gap).** `_parse_adm_xml`'s Resolve-style `tracks` list was built from the **deduped** `object_names` while the summary was count-driven. An IAB package whose objects carry no `audioObjectName` attribute rendered a bed-only track view against a summary correctly reporting 49 objects; duplicate-named objects collapsed to one row. Both are silent wrong-output, not crashes — exactly the class that reaches a delivery. Now count-driven with document-order labels and `Object N` synthesis. 14 tests, mutation-verified.

**Generalizable lesson for future passes:** *audit the gate before trusting the gate.* Any check that can be absent rather than failing — an optional interpreter, a `skipif` fixture, an optional linter, a `|| true` — should be treated as not running until proven otherwise. Two of the five checks in this project's gate were in that category.

**Audit scorecard (5 areas):** IPC/preload+XSS → 2 fixed; path-traversal → 1 fixed; IPC read/delete → clean; HTTP server → clean; **verification integrity → 1 high (gate fails open) + 1 medium (fixture-gated coverage), both fixed**, plus 1 correctness bug fixed in passing.

## 2026-07-26 (6th area) — Fail-open verification, part 2: the JS suite, and structural prevention

The 5th-area audit ended with a lesson rather than a rule: *audit the gate before trusting the gate.* This pass tests whether that lesson generalises past the one instance that produced it. It does.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `test:js` fails loudly on a hand-rolled test failure | ✔ `process.exit(failed ? 1 : 0)` at the foot of each file, and `test:js` loops with `\|\| exit 1` |
| `test:js` fails loudly on a `node:test`-style file | ✔ verified empirically — both `test()` and `describe`/`it` forms exit 1 when run directly under plain `node` |
| Test files fail loudly when a **first-party** module won't load | ✘ **MEDIUM — fails open.** 4 files swallowed any `require()` error on `electron/imf/imf_direct_engine.js` and exited 0 |
| Any npm script neutralises its own exit code (`\|\| true`) | ✔ none |
| The class is structurally prevented from returning | ✘ nothing stopped it → **now gated** |

**Impact.** Same shape as the pytest hole, one layer up: a broken *subject under test* deleting its own tests. `imf_direct_engine.js` is first-party, so its absence is never a legitimate skip condition — but the catch could not tell "engine has a syntax error" from "optional dependency missing" and resolved both to success. 76 assertions covering the realtime engine, progress/cancel, MJPEG reassembly, and the preload↔engine poll contract would have vanished from a green run. This was latent (all four pass today), which is precisely why it survived: a fail-open check is invisible until the day it matters.

**Fixed.** All four catches now print `FAIL - imf_direct_engine failed to load` with the stack and `process.exit(1)`.

**Prevented.** `tools/scan-failopen.mjs --gate`, wired into `build-verify` alongside the XSS and XXE gates. It fails the build on a `catch` that exits 0, a `catch` that logs `SKIP` and bare-returns, or an npm script that discards its exit code. Real optional dependencies remain expressible with `// fail-open-ok: <reason>`, which makes each surviving skip an explicit, greppable, reviewed decision instead of an accident. Mutation-verified against the exact pre-fix source; 13 predicate assertions added to `tests-js/securityGates.test.mjs`.

Worth recording: the gate's own meta-tests exposed a flaw in the gate. The first cut folded the two lines preceding a `catch` into its body so an annotation above the block would count — which meant a preceding catch's `process.exit(0)` leaked into the next catch's verdict. Caught by a two-catch fixture asserting *exactly one* finding. The annotation is now carried as a separate field. A gate that isn't itself unit-tested is just another unaudited check.

**Audit scorecard (6 areas):** IPC/preload+XSS → 2 fixed; path-traversal → 1 fixed; IPC read/delete → clean; HTTP server → clean; verification integrity (Python) → 1 high + 1 medium, both fixed, plus 1 correctness bug; **verification integrity (JS) → 1 medium fixed + 1 structural gate added.** Three of this project's now-six build gates were, at some point, capable of passing without running. That ratio is the finding.

## 2026-07-26 (7th area) — Engine routing: a decision made correctly, then discarded

Scope: the codec→engine decision on both sides of the app — `companion/.../media_engine/media_router.py::select_engine` and `src/scripts/core/playbackRouter.js`, plus every consumer of their return values.

| # | Severity | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **High** | `playableMedia.js` dispatched the router's engine with an `if/else if/else` chain covering only `NativeAVPlayerEngine` and `MPVPlayerEngine`. `PFXNativeEngine` — the preferred ProRes engine, returned on *every* desktop build — fell into the `else` and was sent to the Chromium player the same return had flagged `htmlVideoBlocked: true`. | Fixed |
| 2 | Medium | Consequence of #1 in the proxy-reuse branch: a ProRes clip with a cached proxy commits to the transcoded proxy and returns before the black-frame recovery can run, so the native path is never reached. | Fixed via #1 |
| 3 | Medium | `tests-js/playbackRouter.test.mjs` had 20 assertions, all against `selectPlaybackEngine` — a function with no production callers. The async `selectEngine` that the app actually runs was untested. | Fixed |
| 4 | Low | `window.pfxPlatform?.nativeEngine` was used as a capability check, but preload exposes it as an unconditional object literal — the check can never be false, making the `avf_bridge` and MPV fallback rungs unreachable by construction. | Fixed (now reads `isReady`) |
| 5 | Info | Backlog item C1's premise ("routing split between the companion and `smart_router.js`") is false — `smart_router.js` is a pure HTTP proxy with no decision logic. Seventh stale/incorrect backlog entry. | Recorded |

**Impact.** Every ProRes `.mov` opened on macOS paid a wasted Chromium decode plus a ≥2.5 s black-frame timeout before the canvas engine rescued it; with a cached proxy present, the full-quality native path was never reached at all. The `~5ms/frame` engine the router advertises as preferred was, in the shipped app, only ever reached by a timing heuristic — never by the decision that named it.

**Prevented.** Routing now goes through one exhaustive `pathForEngine()` map; an `ENGINE` constant added without a route fails `tests-js/playbackRouter.test.mjs` rather than silently becoming Chromium, and a source-level assertion blocks reintroducing a hand-written `=== ENGINE.*` chain in the consumer. Both mutation-verified.

**The pattern this shares with areas 5 and 6.** Iterations 1 and 2 found checks that reported success without running. This one is the same shape one layer out: a decision computed correctly, discarded by its consumer, and *masked by a fallback that made the outcome look right*. The black-frame timeout is exactly the kind of resilience that hides the defect it compensates for — the app was never wrong on screen, only slow, so nothing ever surfaced. Fallbacks should be instrumented, not just installed; the natural follow-up is C-RT2, a HUD naming the backend that served each frame, which would have made this visible on the first ProRes open.

**Audit scorecard (7 areas):** IPC/preload+XSS → 2 fixed; path-traversal → 1 fixed; IPC read/delete → clean; HTTP server → clean; verification integrity (Python) → 1 high + 1 medium + 1 correctness, fixed; verification integrity (JS) → 1 medium fixed + gate added; **engine routing → 1 high + 2 medium + 1 low, all fixed.** Four of the seven areas turned up a defect whose defining feature was that it produced no visible symptom.

## 2026-07-26 (8th area) — JPEG 2000 decoder routing: one question, three answers

Scope: every place that decides HTJ2K (Part 15) vs classic (Part 1) and picks a decoder — `src/sandbox/j2k_decoder.js`, `src/scripts/modules/imf/imf_j2k.js`, `src/scripts/modules/imf/imf_player.js` — plus the per-frame call path from the IMF player.

| # | Severity | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **High** | `imf_j2k.js::decodeHTJ2K` performed no codestream classification. On desktop it sent **every** J2K frame to OpenJPH, an HT-only decoder, so classic Part 1 IMF essence paid a full copy into the WASM heap plus a thrown exception *per frame* before falling through to the sandbox. Nothing disables the direct path after a failure, so the cost repeats for the whole clip. | Fixed |
| 2 | Medium | The same function accepted `0xFF50` as an alternative SOC, documented as the "HTJ2K SOC". No such marker exists — `0xFF50` is CAP and cannot appear at offset 0. Dead branch built on a wrong premise. | Fixed |
| 3 | Medium | Three independent parses of the same header. Only the sandbox's tested the capability bit; `imf_player.js::parseJ2KHeader` extracted `rsiz` correctly and used it for display only. | Fixed (two converged; the third is queued) |
| 4 | Medium | No decode-route instrumentation anywhere. Nothing recorded which backend served a frame or how many direct attempts were thrown away, which is why #1 was invisible. | Fixed (`getDecodeRouteStats`) |
| 5 | Low | The new test suite initially built its HT fixtures from the constant under test, so a wrong-capability-bit mutation passed. Caught by mutation testing, not by review. | Fixed (literal fixtures) |

**Impact.** Silent, unbounded, per-frame waste on the most common IMF profile, on the one platform where the fast path is enabled. As in area 7, the *output* was always correct — the sandbox rescued every frame — so the only symptom was slowness and a repeating `console.warn` that reads like routine fallback chatter rather than a routing bug.

**Prevented.** One exported classifier, imported by both consumers, with source-level assertions that neither re-derives it and that the sandbox no longer defines its own copy. Unreadable headers resolve to classic, never HT — the asymmetry is deliberate: the classic rung has a pure-JS fallback behind it and the HT rung has nothing, so the conservative answer is the safe one. Four mutations verified.

**The pattern, now stated in general form.** Area 7 was *a decision made correctly and discarded by its consumer*. This is the next step out: **the same decision derived independently in N places will disagree, and the copy that's wrong is the one nobody tested.** The sandbox's sniff was right and unit-testable; the copy on the hot path had never been isolated from WASM and so had never been tested at all. Convergence on a single exported predicate is what makes the question testable exactly once. Finding #5 is the same disease inside the cure — a fixture derived from the value it validates is another copy that agrees with itself.

**Audit scorecard (8 areas):** IPC/preload+XSS → 2 fixed; path-traversal → 1 fixed; IPC read/delete → clean; HTTP server → clean; verification integrity (Python) → 1 high + 1 medium + 1 correctness, fixed; verification integrity (JS) → 1 medium fixed + gate added; engine routing → 1 high + 2 medium + 1 low, fixed; **J2K decoder routing → 1 high + 3 medium + 1 low, all fixed.** Five of the eight areas turned up a defect with no visible symptom, and in three of those the thing that hid it was a fallback doing its job.

---

## 2026-07-26 (9th area) — Decode-route observability: instrumentation nobody reads

Scope: the operator HUD in `imf_player.js` and the route counters added in area 8.

| # | Severity | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Medium | `getDecodeRouteStats()` was exported by `imf_j2k.js` and called from nowhere. The counters that would have made area 8's routing bug visible were themselves invisible — the fix shipped its own blind spot. | Fixed |
| 2 | Medium | The real-time HUD reported fps, scale, drops and decode-ms but never named the decoder. The four rungs of the ladder — direct OpenJPH, sandbox HT, sandbox OpenJPEG, pure-JS baseline — are visually identical, so a clip silently running on the JS baseline looked like a clip that was merely slow. | Fixed |
| 3 | Medium | The HUD painted itself green on cadence alone. A reel holding 24 fps on the pure-JS fallback decoder was reported as healthy. | Fixed (`route.degraded` outranks `cadenceOk`) |
| 4 | Low | Route counters were process-lifetime cumulative while every adjacent counter (`droppedFrames`, `lastFrameAdvance`) reset per reel, so the previous reel's backend could colour the current one. | Fixed (reset on reel load) |

**Impact.** Diagnostic only — no wrong pixels. But the whole justification for area 8's counters was that a fallback doing its job hides the defect behind it, and a counter with no readout hides it just as well. The QC-relevant case is #2: when the WASM OpenJPEG decoder fails, the pure-JS baseline takes over and produces correct frames far more slowly. On screen that is indistinguishable from a heavy reel.

**Prevented.** The summariser is a pure function over the stats object, unit-tested from both sides of its one threshold, and the player's use of it is asserted at source level — bound, computed, pushed into the HUD line, and consulted for the fill colour. A future edit that computes the route and forgets to render it fails the suite, which is exactly the failure this area was opened to fix.

**The pattern.** Areas 7 and 8 were *a correct value discarded by its consumer*. This one is the degenerate case: **a correct value with no consumer at all.** Instrumentation is not complete when the counter increments; it is complete when a human can act on it without a debugger. Worth noting that the gap was introduced by the previous iteration and found by the next one — the audit loop caught its own work, which is the only reason it was a one-iteration gap rather than a permanent one.

**Audit scorecard (9 areas):** IPC/preload+XSS → 2 fixed; path-traversal → 1 fixed; IPC read/delete → clean; HTTP server → clean; verification integrity (Python) → 1 high + 1 medium + 1 correctness, fixed; verification integrity (JS) → 1 medium fixed + gate added; engine routing → 1 high + 2 medium + 1 low, fixed; J2K decoder routing → 1 high + 3 medium + 1 low, fixed; **decode-route observability → 3 medium + 1 low, all fixed.** Six of the nine areas turned up a defect with no visible symptom. In four of those, the thing hiding it was a fallback doing its job — and in this one, the thing hiding it was the absence of anywhere to look.

---

## 2026-07-26 (10th area) — Unbounded retry on a failing fast path

Scope: the direct OpenJPH rung in `imf_j2k.js::decodeHTJ2K`, and the strike latch added to bound it.

| # | Severity | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Medium | An HT codestream this build's OpenJPH cannot decode was retried on the direct path **every frame** for the whole reel — a full codestream copy into the WASM heap plus a thrown exception each time, always ending in the same fallthrough. Area 8's sniff closed this for classic essence and left it open for incompatible HT. | Fixed (3-strike latch) |
| 2 | Medium | The failure warned once per frame. At 24 fps that is 1,440 console entries a minute, which buries the diagnostic it is writing and, with devtools attached, costs real time on the decode thread. | Fixed (logs on the tripping call only) |
| 3 | Low | `_loadDirectHTModule()` memoises a permanent failure and resolves `null` forever, but nothing recorded that the fast path was off. The HUD showed no waste and no explanation — the rung simply never appeared. | Fixed (trips the latch, surfaced as `(HT off)`) |
| 4 | Low | `createStrikeLatch` clamped its limit with `Math.max(1, …)`. Every degenerate value already produces the identical outcome, so the guard could not change any observable behaviour. A mutation removing it passed the suite. | Fixed (clamp deleted) |

**Impact.** Performance and diagnosability, not correctness — the sandbox rescued every frame, as it has in every finding on this path. The reason this kept recurring is worth naming: the decode ladder is four rungs deep, and each rung's fallback is good enough to hide the rung above it failing. Area 8 found the misroute, area 9 found that nothing displayed it, and this one found that nothing *stopped* it.

**On not crying wolf.** A latched fast path is reported but is explicitly **not** treated as degraded. It is the mechanism that ended the waste, and the direct rung can fail for reasons local to the main-page WASM heap while the sandbox decodes at full speed. Degradation is still judged on the backend actually serving frames. Marking every latch red would have made the one signal that matters — the pure-JS baseline serving playback — indistinguishable from a reel that is completely fine.

**Prevented.** The tripping rule is an exported, dependency-free factory, so consecutive-vs-cumulative semantics are unit-tested without a DOM or a decode; the hot path's use of it is asserted at source level. Eight mutations verified.

**The pattern, and finding #4 as its second instance.** Iteration 4 recorded *a fixture derived from the value under test agrees with itself*. Finding #4 is the same disease with a different vector: **a test labelled for a mechanism it cannot distinguish from that mechanism's absence.** Both report coverage that does not exist, and neither is visible to review — only a mutation finds them. The response here was to delete the mechanism rather than write a better test for it, which is the right order of operations: if no test can tell whether the code is there, the code is not doing anything.

**Audit scorecard (10 areas):** IPC/preload+XSS → 2 fixed; path-traversal → 1 fixed; IPC read/delete → clean; HTTP server → clean; verification integrity (Python) → 1 high + 1 medium + 1 correctness, fixed; verification integrity (JS) → 1 medium fixed + gate added; engine routing → 1 high + 2 medium + 1 low, fixed; J2K decoder routing → 1 high + 3 medium + 1 low, fixed; decode-route observability → 3 medium + 1 low, fixed; **unbounded fast-path retry → 2 medium + 2 low, all fixed.** Seven of the ten areas turned up a defect with no visible symptom. In five of those, a fallback doing its job was what hid it — the J2K decode ladder alone accounts for three consecutive areas, one per rung of hiding.
